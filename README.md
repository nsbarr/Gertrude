Gertrude is a visual poem designed for iOS. 

Gertrude was inspired by these lines in Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons:

"In the morning there is meaning, in the evening there is feeling..."

Your experience of Gertrude changes depending on the time at which you open the app. 

Cheating is discouraged.

Gertrude is almost certainly of no interest from a code perspective.

I would love to see more elegant solutions to the background-color-changing code.
